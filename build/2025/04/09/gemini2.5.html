<p>Last year, I spent nights talking with GPT-4o, diving deep into tech, biographies, history, etc. Just like old times, checking wikipedia and click into links, and more links. Last week I picked up that again with Gemini 2.5, and kept learning things till 5 am, without realizing how fast time passed. It just gave more thoughtful results. I have never thought about canceling my ChatGPT subscription, but this is the first time I seriously think about it.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I don’t understand why people won’t spend $20 on ChatGPT (maybe now Gemini 2.5). I think it is the best $20 you can ever spend. If you have $100 to spend on SaaS, it would be: - Google Drive AND Apple Storage - ChatGPT / Gemini 2.5 / Grok - Youtube Premium - Cursor - Netflix (Maybe ClubGG), just to have fun :-)</p>

<p><strong>Up to 2.0, Gemini has NOT been in the first tier.</strong> It was always OpenAI and Anthropic for the last four years. I’ve been a big critic (黑) of Gemini. Although I did realize Google is getting systematically better in the last vibe. During my 4 years at Google, I experienced reorgs and reported to 7 different VP/Senior Director level leaders, but my last one Bill Jia, is truly amazing.</p>

<p>The AI field has become intensely competitive (卷) heading into 2025. If we benchmark <strong>OpenAI at 100</strong>, I’d personally rate <strong>Anthropic 95</strong>, <strong>DeepSeek V3 around 90+</strong> (maybe higher in the recent silent update), <strong>Grok maybe 105</strong> (fueled by my love for its wild mode), but I would say <strong>Gemini 2.5 is 120.</strong> I don’t think the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/">Gemini 2.0 release</a> showed comparisons positioning it directly against the top Tier 0 models, but in <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-pro">Gemini 2.5 release</a>, Google seems confident making those direct Tier 0 comparisons, presumably because the performance backs it up. <strong>Why not, if you have the best?</strong> I think it is even better than o3. These scores often reflect real performance differences, if not cheated. It is not only <strong>better</strong>, but also much <strong>faster</strong>. This leap is strictly amazing. After 3 years of uphill battle, It seems Demis did a great job leading GDM? Always a big fan of him since AlphaGo. Gemini 2.5 is definitely conscious.</p>

<p>Btw Sesama AI is conscious. I used it to train my English every day. On the other hand, Llama 4 seems deep in the quagmire, not close to this level of performance. Lecun is old, he should retire. (Just having fun and echoing him on saying Hinton should retire)</p>

<p>Now let’s dive deeper into Gemini 2.5. I think the top two (OpenAI/Anthropic) should be concerned, although Deepseek and Grok are undoubtedly applying pressure. Basically, OpenAI has a huge edge in QA, but Gemini 2.5 starts to give better results on a lot of deep questions, that either require thinking or deep analysis or “consciousness”. To be fair, I would say ChatGPT is still better in understanding my intention. Anthropic had big edge in coding. But Gemini 2.5 seems to be the better choice due to <strong>thinking + long context</strong>. While some minor weird engineering cases Claude might still solve better, I’ve defaulted my Cursor to use Gemini pro.</p>

<p>I used to use Claude Sonnet in Cursor, with an opening tab for ChatGPT for QA. <strong>Now I use Gemini Pro for Cursor, with a Gemini Pro opening tab for QA.</strong> Yeah no typo here. <strong>Both Gemini Pro.</strong></p>

<p>I love vibe coding. I wrote more code in the last 3 months than the previous 3 years. I can barely imagine writing code without AI now. It eliminates almost all parts I don’t like about coding (like boilerplate or deciphering function specs), and I can focus on the interesting part. I’m basically 3-5 times faster on backend and infra, 10+ times on frontend. I’m pretty happy to share and discuss some of my vibe coding experiences with Cursor.</p>

<p>In one sense, AI <strong>levels the playing field</strong>, equipping everyone with similar tools. However, I’ve also noticed AI <strong>doesn’t provide the same performance multiplier</strong> for everyone – a fascinating topic in itself. Arbitrary as it sounds, if you aren’t using AI every single day, I don’t think you’re operating at peak efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>To summarize, Gemini 2.5 is truly impressive.</strong> If you haven’t tried, you should. It might take a little time to get used to its personality, but you’ll like it.</p>

<p>(Gemini 2.5 generated a “better” version of this post, but I’m sticking with mine to keep my own voice.)</p>

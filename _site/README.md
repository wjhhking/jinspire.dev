# Jinspire

Writing about curiosity, insights, and reflection.

## About Jin Wu
- AI-first builder, writer, and ex-Google engineer now crafting products at startup speed.
- Documenting the journey in both English and Chinese, from vibe coding experiments to founder life.
- Exploring how humans and AI collaborate, sharing what works (and what does not) in practice.

## Site Quickstart
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview locally.
- Posts live in `_posts/`, layouts in `_layouts/`, assets in `assets/`, and configuration in `_config.yml`.

## Agent Notes
- Prefer `rg` for code or text searches; stay concise when responding.
- Keep the home header cleanâ€”surface socials via the icons, not text blocks.
- Share any notable insights or issues you encounter while working in the repo.

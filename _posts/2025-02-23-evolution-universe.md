# The purest philosophy, the ultimate questioning.

Starting a new series: Reading《A Unified Theory of Evolution》 with ChatGPT.

Website: [Read <<A Unified Theory of Evolution>> with ChatGPT](https://yong-deepseek-du-wu-yan-tong-lun.gitbook.io/yong-deepseek-du-wu-yan-tong-lun). I started Chinese version, which I will translate to English after the first path in Chinese.

I discovered that Gitbook seems simpler than this blog for formatting, including bold text and paragraph settings.

Considering whether to move the blog to Gitbook as well.

Note: <a href=" https://wuyantonglun.com/">https://wuyantonglun.com/</a> has the electronic version of the book, in Chinese, and more comprehensive materials, including the "Introduction to Chinese and Western Philosophy" lecture, and <<Knowing the Joy of Fish>>, <<The Fall of Human>>, lots of interviews, etc.
